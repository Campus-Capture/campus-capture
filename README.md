_Campus Capture_ is a competitive team-game centered around the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/fr/) campus.  
If you are a student at EPFL, you can take part in the fight to get your school to win!  

In _Campus Capture_, zones are scattered around the campus. _And there are more than 30 of them for you to get control of!_  
Each zone grants you funds to buy power-ups that can change the course of a battle, and ultimately the War.  

Power-ups are choosen participately through totally rethought mechanics, and coordination with your team will be necessary to get the advantage.  
We recommend you bring your friends, or meet new ones in the Battle! Creating a chat group with your team is recommended ;)
